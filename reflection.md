# what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
plan which parts you are doing first so you don't get lost along the way and do other parts that are secondary

# did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
I could not complete my needs to have in time for the project to end. i didn't have time to finish the level select or mods. the sliders were too difficult to do with the knowledge i have.

# What was the hardest part of the project?
getting more then one circle to show up on screen at a time.

#  Were there any problems you could not solve?
sliders and score.
