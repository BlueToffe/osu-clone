knows coding
pro:
-The game looks really good
-The music is good too

cons: 
-It's kind of hard to tell if you hit a circle (atleast to me)
-No penalty for missing (yet?)
-It took me a second to figure out the controls, even though you told me what they were (skill issue and because I could not tell if I was hitting a circle)
-The default level is too hard for me (major skill issue)
-If you make it to the end of a level, and press enter again, the music restarts but the game does not
-I think that's all
-Hopefully that's useful
